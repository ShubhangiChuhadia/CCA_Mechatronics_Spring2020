## Mechatronics at California College of the Arts, Spring 2019

### Syllabus

* Title: DESGN-636-02 Expanded Tools: Mechatronics
* Class: Monday 8:00am - 11:00am, Room 107 SF Main (SF Hybrid Lab)
* Instructor: Sudhu Tewari stewari@cca.edu or loopstick@hotmail.com
* Office hours: 
	* Monday & Thursdays 11:00 - 11:30
	* and at other times by appointment

#### Goals
My goal is to teach you how to design, build, and debug [mechatronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics) devices. 
I want to make the course as interesting and relevant as possible for you, so please ask questions and bring up specific topics you are curious about.

#### Github and Class Repository
We will be using a cloud service called Github. Our repository is at
https://github.com/loopstick/Mechatronics-CCA-Spring-2019/

The class repository will be used to assign homework and reading assignments, and will contain useful code, libraries, and links to other resources. Github allows you to receive email updates when a repository changes — take advantage of this feature!

You will be required to create your own repository for handing in homework and for project documentation. 

#### Required Textbook
No textbook is required. There are many good online references and a few good books out there I can recommend. We also have a good assortment of books in the library. Highly recommended: Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts http://www.makingthingsmove.com/about-the-book/

#### Prerequisites
* Basic algebra. You should be comfortable with simple equations, manipulating numbers, fractions, solving for variables, and the
engineering prefixes (micro, milli, kilo, mega, etc.)
* Some understanding of geometry and basic physics will also be helpful.

#### Requirements and Expectations
* Always bring your computer to class. If you don’t have a computer, check one out from the Media Center. You will need a computer to
participate, and your grade will be negatively affected if you don’t bring one.
* Always bring your electronics: Arduino, breadboard, motors, jumper wires, etc. to class.
* Participate in class! Ask questions, guess answers, propose topics, share interesting projects you’ve found, push the envelope, explore your interests, and teach us all! There are no stupid questions; admitting when you don’t know something should be a point of pride. Chances are you’re not the only one with a question, just the bravest one. 
* As outlined in the CCA Student Handbook, attendance in class is mandatory and three or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade.
* Plan to spend 3-12 hours a week on homework. If you don’t have a solid foundation in math you may need more time. Plan ahead!
* Submit your homework on time.  Write clearly and legibly. Attend class, and don’t be late. These are not requests, these are requirements.
* You are responsible for checking your email and the class repository for updates.

#### Access & Wellness Services
CCA says:
> Students with disabilities, including disabilities that are not clearly evident like chronic diseases or learning disabilities are encouraged to notify their instructor after class or during office hours. CCA will make reasonable accommodations for persons with documented disabilities. Students should contact Suzanne Raffeld, Director of Access and Wellness Services (email: sraffeld@cca.edu; phone:510.594.3775), to answer any questions or for assistance. For more information, consult CCA's webpage at: http://www.cca.edu/ students/resources/disability.

I want you to succeed in this class. Please make use of the Hybrid Lab coaches, the Learning Resource Center, and talk to me if you feel you are struggling with the material — I can help you do better in this class, but only if you let me know you need help.

#### Class Format
Sessions will be a mix of lectures, guided labs, and independent work time. Homework will require research, analysis, and experimentation. Engineering always takes more time than you think — please make sure to give yourself enough time!

#### Grading
I will consider the various components of the class in roughly the following proportions:
* 25% Homework & Assignments
* 40% Projects and Project Documentation
* 25% In-Class Hands-on Work and Notebook
* 10% Attendance & Participation

#### Grading Rubric
 
**A: Excellent.** You’ve exhibited exemplary conceptual, technical and
perceptual ability implementing projects. You’ve demonstrated a deft
understanding of required readings, and ability to successfully
communicate ideas and processes to others. All work is commented and
clearly demonstrates understanding of each lesson. 

**B: Good.** You’ve completed assignments, and demonstrated a grasp of 
most of the main aspects of each lesson, but not all. You’re able to
communicate information, and step by step processes well. In projects,
conceptual, perceptual, and technical skills are present.

**C: Satisfactory.** You’ve completed the assignments but may lack
enthusiasm or drive to push the work into detailed display of
comprehension. You have not demonstrated comprehensive knowledge of
the application or programming environment. 

**D: Unsatisfactory.** You have not completed the work as assigned.
Substantial problems exist in your work.

**F: Fail.** You did not submit work, or work is below unsatisfactory level.


#### Words of Advice
Exploration is a key part of this class. You’ll get more out of your work if you give yourself extra time and have patience. Sometimes you’ll hit a dead end and have to start over — don’t despair, it happens to everyone, but give yourself extra time just in case.
This class should be both fun and intense. It’s most fun when you enjoy what you’re working on, so make a point of taking some time to explore projects you make want to work on in the future!


#### Required equipment
- _Arduino Uno R3__ e.g. from
	[Arduino](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/a000066) or 
	[Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) or
	[Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/A000066-Arduino-Arduino-Uno-R3-DIP-Edition-Revision-3-_2151486.html) or
  	[Arduino](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBZ4CII/3) via
	[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GRTSV6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=AA57DDZKZUZDL&psc=1).
    - Not recommended: Arduino compatibles, especially those from untested sources. Many sellers on Amazon or Ebay are selling cut-rate knock offs that _sometimes_ work and sometimes _do not_.
    - Also not recommended: [Adafruit Metro - Uno compatible](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50). Although Adafruit is typically a great source, the Metro FTDI drivers are less than simple and straightforward to get working and keep working consistently.
    
- _Solderless breadboard_, full size (also known as 830 tie point) e.g. from
	[Jameco](http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?search_type=jamecoall&catalogId=10001&freeText=2157706&langId=-1&productId=2157706&storeId=10001&ddkey=http:StoreCatalogDrillDownView)
- Full size _USB cable_ (type A to type B) e.g. from [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/10U2-02203-BK-Cable-USB2-0-A-B-3-Feet-Black-USB-A-Male-To-USB-B-Male_222608.html)
- Pack of _jumper wires_ e.g. from [Jameco](https://www.jameco.com/z/MKSEEED3-65-Piece-Reinforced-Jumper-Wire-Set_2229191.html) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Solderless-Flexible-Breadboard-Jumper-Arduino/dp/B00ARTWJ44/ref=pd_lpo_328_lp_t_4?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=N9HAJ64FXQ5JZV55JGX3)
- _Output_ devices for your projects: LEDs, speakers, motors, etc.
- _Sensors_ for your project
- _Laptop_ (Windows, Linux, or Macintosh)
  - Highly recommended if you plan to use motors: 
    - Adafruit [Motor/Stepper/Servo Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1438)
    - also get [Shield Stacking Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/85) if you plan to use sensors or another shield

If ordering online I encourage you to organize a group purchase to save on shipping fees, but do so immediately so you have the equipment on hand.
Many vendors grant discounts for educational purposes so ask before you purchase. 
 - The code ADAEDU may be good for 10% educational discount at Adafruit. 
 - Mentioning that you are a student of mine may get you a discount at Al Lasher’s.

Local stores that should carry all these are:
* [Jameco](http://www.jameco.com) in Belmont, just south of the SFO airport. Order online and pick up same day.
* [Al Lasher's Electronics](http://allashers.com/) in Berkeley
* [Fry's Electronics](http://www.frys.com) (various locations in South Bay) has some electronic supplies 


#### Optional equipment
As you develop your projects and interests, you might need to purchase additional components and devices. This is impossible to predict as the range of projects you might approach are indeed infinite. At the low end, you can build amazing projects from discarded electronic devices such as printers at absolutely no cost; at the high end there is no limit; a complicated robotic project could easily start at hundreds of dollars. 

#### Some lessons I’ve learned:
- Projects will cost more than you think they will
- Projects will take longer than you think they will
- You will order parts that are wrong or that you simply decide not to use. Be ready to accept this. Consider these items you might
trade with other students (or the larger maker community) for parts that you do need, especially when you need that part urgently.
- You will spend less time and money if you are flexible about your concept. Allow prototype iterations to modify your concept, not just your execution. The reverse is also true: If you strongly want to stick to your concept, be prepared to spend more time and money. The common way of looking at this is to consider that there is a relationship between time, money, and features. You can choose any two of them, and the third will grow (or shrink) to accommodate.

      	- image here please
     - shaft coupling
  - Make your motors go!
  
- **Homework:**
  - Motorize your contraption!	
  - Take a short video of your Motorized Mechanical Contraption (MMC) and upload it to your Github repository
	
### Week 5: Monday, February 18, 2019
- Motorized Contraptions critique
- Lecture
  - ARDUINO Introduction
- Lab
  - Arduino [Tutorial](https://github.com/loopstick/ArduinoTutorial)

- **Homework:** 
	- **play with your Arduino**
	  - make something _interesting_ happen with 2 LEDs
	    - think about how this might relate to controlling two motors
	  - Review the Basic Arduino [Tutorial](https://github.com/loopstick/ArduinoTutorial)
	  we did in class. Read the entire tutorial, even the parts we didn't do
	  - You might want to refer to some other Arduino material. There is plenty
	online, such as the [Arduino Resources](https://github.com/loopstick/ResourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources) 
	on our class [Resources](https://github.com/loopstick/ResourcesForClasses) page
	  - Read about controlling Motors with Arduino - (Must use a transistor or boom! - Arduino up in smoke): 
	    - [Arduino Transistor Motor Control: Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/TransistorMotorControl)
	    - [Using a Transistor to Control High Current Loads: ITP @ NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/)
	- **Build a simple drawing machine.** or _modify/develop/improve/**finish** your motorized mechanical contraption_
	  - The only requirement is that it is somehow motorized and that it leaves a mark on a piece of paper. You may use Arduino if you wish, but you are not required to.  You may use sensors if you wish, but you are not required to. Your drawing may be as complex or as simple as you wish.
	    - Control the speed of the motor using [analogWrite](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/) to prevent damage to your contraption. I recommend starting with a very slow speed at first. (i.e. set analogWrite to 127, 50% of full speed)
              - Here is an example Arduino program that just sets the speed of the motor and doesn't change anything:
	[setMotorSpeed](/examples/setMotorSpeed) 
	  - The ability to easily turn on and off the machine is typically very desirable.
	    - Study the Arduino Button [tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Button)
        - Take a short video of your _working_ Drawing Machine and upload it to your Github repository

### Week 6: Monday, February 25, 2019
- Drawing Machines critique
- Lecture
  - Controlling motors (or  other high current loads) with Arduino: from our class tutorial:  [Controlling Large Load witha . Transistor](https://github.com/loopstick/ArduinoTutorial/blob/master/README.md#controlling-large-loads-with-a-transistor)
    - the importance of a [flyback diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_diode)
    - [Arduino Transistor Motor Control: Arduino Reference](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/TransistorMotorControl)
    - [Using a Transistor to Control High Current Loads: ITP @ NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/motors-and-transistors/using-a-transistor-to-control-high-current-loads-with-an-arduino/)
  - other electromechanical devices
    - relays
    - solenoids
    - speakers
    - electromagnets
  - Adafruit Motor Shield demo
  
- **Homework:**
	- Build an electrical vehicle (2 week project) or _continue to develop your mechanical contraption_
		- Must be able to steer in one way or another
		- Can be either autonomous or wired remote control
			- Autonomous: Arduino decides what to do
			- Remote controlled: User tells it what to do 
			- Wired remote control: Whatever the user interacts with (e.g.
				pushbuttons or a joy stick) is connected to the vehicle by wires
			- Wireless remote control: Whatever the user interacts with 
				communicates wirelessly (e.g. Bluetooth, WiFi, or InfraRed) with the
				vehicle. This is complicated and not recommended at this time.
			- Hint: Autonomous is easier because you don't have to build a user
				interface
		- Remember the principle of _Minimum Viable Product_. First get the basics 
			working, then, if you have time, add other features
		- This is a 2 week project. You should have a pretty solid
			prototype or first draft working by next week. Use class next
			week as an opportunity to solve problems.
		- You may check out servo motors and motor shields from the Hybrid Lab
		- As always
			- Email me if you have questions
			- Make a new folder on your Github repository for this project
			- Put your code in that folder. 
			- Put a schematic in that folder. Hand drawn is fine.  
				If you want to use the schematic capture program that
				I use, get it [here](http://fritzing.org)
	- Additional resources:
		- [Summer Robotics](http://teachmetomake.com/wordpress/arduino-robotics-cca-summer2016) class that might have some useful ideas
		- [H-bridge tutorial](http://teachmetomake.com/wordpress/arduino-tutorial-h-bridge) in case you want to go that far (allows you to reverse your motors, although you are not required to do this)
